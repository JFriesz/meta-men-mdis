# RTAI applications

# The include directory used when building user mode libraries
# and applications. If you're doing selfhosted development,

# development, select the include directory of your cross
# compiler. Leave it blank if your compiler doesn't need this
# setting.

# LIN_USR_INC_DIR

# Define whether to build/use static or shared user state

# the libraries. "shared" mode makes programs smaller but
# requires installation of shared libraries on the target
